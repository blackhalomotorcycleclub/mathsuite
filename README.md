# Math Learning Suite

This repository contains a suite of Python scripts that teach basic concepts in calculus, algebra, trigonometry, and basic math operations.

## Main Script

The `main.py` script serves as the main entry point for the math learning suite. The script includes a menu that allows the user to select one of the four math types and then runs the corresponding script.

To run the main script, make sure you have all four scripts (`calculus.py`, `algebra.py`, `trigonometry.py`, and `bedmas.py`) in the same directory as the main script. Then, simply run the command `python main.py`.

## Calculus

The `calculus.py` script teaches basic concepts of calculus such as limits, derivatives, and integrals. The script uses the `sympy` library to perform symbolic calculations.

To run the script directly, make sure you have `sympy` installed and then run the command `python calculus.py`.

## Algebra

The `algebra.py` script teaches basic concepts of algebra such as solving equations and simplifying expressions. The script uses the `sympy` library to perform symbolic calculations.

To run the script directly, make sure you have `sympy` installed and then run the command `python algebra.py`.

## Trigonometry

The `trigonometry.py` script teaches basic concepts of trigonometry such as sine, cosine, and tangent. The script uses the `math` module from the Python standard library.

To run the script directly, simply run the command `python trigonometry.py`.

## BEDMAS

The `bedmas.py` script teaches basic math operations and follows the BEDMAS order: Brackets, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction. The script includes a menu for selecting a specific operation and progresses through the operations in the BEDMAS order.

To run the script directly, simply run the command `python bedmas.py`.
